					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab was to dig depper into javascript and experiment with JavaScript Events and buttons.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I only had one problem while doing this lab. I forgot you have to attach everyhting to something else aka links.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
                    <p> I was so confused at first on what to do.  I was able to accomplish using an API to get information from an external source.  I parsed it like it was shown in class just so I would get only the text part of the fact.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
            <div id="output">
                    <p> Lets see, if i did this right, some random cat fact should replace this text here, bye!</p>
