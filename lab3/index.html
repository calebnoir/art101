			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of this lab was to create a file structure and add index.html files to it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The only difficult problem that arose was adding my pictures to the file.  Everything else in the assignment did not seem to be a problem for me </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment made me realize how important it is to have a organized file structure. I will for sure use a template like this on my own in the future outside of this class. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>If you look above you can see my Lab 3 Webpage, if you look below you can see a screenshot of the file structure:  </p>
